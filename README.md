# -CBD-Supa-Shield-p53-
CBD Supa Shield p53 is a novel therapeutic concept combining cannabidiol (CBD) and linalool nanoparticles (Lin-NPs) to selectively induce apoptosis in dysfunctional cells, such as cancer or neurodegenerative cells, by restoring the tumor suppressor p53.
üéØ Core Mechanism
The (CBD)x(Lin-NPs) complex enables targeted blood-brain barrier penetration. Inside cells, it executes a multi-pronged attack:
Foundation: CBD‚Äôs potent antioxidant activity quenches ROS, suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome and reducing neuroinflammation (‚ÜìIL-1Œ≤, ‚ÜìIL-18).
Priming: The combo inhibits the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, inducing cellular stress and activating the pro-apoptotic transcription factor FOXO3.
The ‚ÄúSupa Shield‚Äù: CBD acts as a pharmacological chaperone, refolding mutant, misfolded p53 into its functional form. This releases sequestered p73 and partners with FOXO3.
Execution: Functional p53/p73/FOXO3 drives transcription of pro-apoptotic proteins (PUMA, NOXA, BAX), overwhelming cellular defenses and triggering mitochondrial apoptosis.
Amplification: Secondary pathways (TRAIL, PPARŒ≥ activation) create a virtuous cycle, reinforcing cell death and anti-inflammatory effects.
‚ú® Key Advantages
High Selectivity: Targets p53-mutant and stressed cells, sparing healthy tissue.
Synergistic Formulation: Linalool NPs enhance delivery; CBD provides both therapeutic and chaperone activity.
Virtuous Cascade: Creates a self-reinforcing loop of reduced inflammation and increased apoptosis.
